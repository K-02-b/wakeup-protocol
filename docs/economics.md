# WakeUp Protocol: The Economics of Discipline

WakeUp Protocol is built on a high-stakes **"Burn or Earn"** model. We believe that self-discipline is a valuable asset, and those who fail to protect it must pay the price.

## 1. The Stake-to-Wake Mechanism
To participate, users must lock a daily stake. This is not a subscription; it is a financial commitment to your future self.

- **Proof Requirement:** AI-verified handwriting of a dynamic phrase.
- **The Outcome:** - **Success:** Proof submitted and verified. Principal returned.
    - **Failure:** No proof or invalid proof. Stake is immediately **Slashed**.

## 2. The Slash Distribution (The Protocol Law)

When a user fails, their stake is distributed according to the following hardcore deflationary logic:

| Destination | Allocation | Impact |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| 🔥 **The Burn** | **50%** | Slashed tokens are burned forever. This creates constant deflationary pressure, making discipline a fuel for scarcity. |
| 💰 **The Reward** | **40%** | Distributed to the "Early Birds" who successfully verified. The losers literally pay for the winners' success. |
| 🏗️ **The Treasury** | **10%** | Fuels the AI compute and continuous protocol development. |

## 3. Game Theory: Why it Works
- **Skin in the Game:** Most habit trackers fail because there is no pain in quitting. WakeUp Protocol introduces real financial pain.
- **Anti-Bot Integrity:** AI handwriting analysis ensures that rewards go to real humans, not scripts. The cost of faking a handwritten note exceeds the potential reward for cheating.
- **Pure Meritocracy:** The protocol does not create new tokens out of thin air; it redistributes value from the undisciplined to the disciplined.

## 4. Future Scaling
As the protocol grows, we will introduce **Tiered Staking**, where users with longer "Wake-up Streaks" can access higher-reward pools, further incentivizing long-term consistency.
